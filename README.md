Title: Stateside Test 

Release Date: 3/30/2017 
 
Observations: 
 Thanks for the amazing opportunity, I hope you find my job pleasing.
 I learned a lot and have so much more knowledge than I had before starting this personal and
 professional challenge. Thank you Stateside! 
 
Tools Used: 
Bootstrap, JQuery, SASS in the carousel.css, I didn't use the pre-runner (Grunt,Gulp)
because the only JS that I use in this project is the bootstrap.min.js. and it's already Pre-runned and
compressed. 

 Tested & Fully working on: Google Chrome, Safari, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer.
